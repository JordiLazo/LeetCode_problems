Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given an integer k and a binary search tree, find the floor (less than or equal to) of k, and the ceiling (larger than or equal to) of k. If either does not exist, then print them as None.

Here is the definition of a node for the tree.

# A class to store a BST node
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, left=None, right=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


# Recursive function to insert a key into a BST
def insert(root, key):
    # if the root is None, create a new node and return it
    if root is None:
        return Node(key)

    # if the given key is less than the root node, recur for the left subtree
    if key < root.data:
        root.left = insert(root.left, key)

    # if the given key is more than the root node, recur for the right subtree
    else:
        root.right = insert(root.right, key)

    return root


# Recursive function to find the floor and ceil of a given key in a BST
# using a Wrapper
def findFloorCeil(root, floor, ceil, key):
    # base case
    if root is None:
        return floor, ceil

    # if a node with the desired value is found, both floor and ceil is equal
    # to the current node
    if root.data == key:
        return root, root

    # if the given key is less than the root node, recur for the left subtree
    elif key < root.data:
        # update ceil to the current node before visiting the left subtree
        return findFloorCeil(root.left, floor, root, key)

    # if the given key is more than the root node, recur for the right subtree
    else:
        # update floor to the current node before visiting the right subtree
        return findFloorCeil(root.right, root, ceil, key)
